## Introduction

Topic: Prostate cancer data analysis
Data source: Vanderbilt biostatistics dataset

Main work we did:
-


## Variables
- Two types:-

-- Categorical and Numerical


## Data cleaning

- Importing the file into data table format
- Conversion of character types into numerical values for better analysis
e.g. placebo--> '0' mg estrogen
- Writing variables in more 'readable' format
e.g. sz--> tumor size


## Data analysis

- Error and Trial method- built lots of linear models using different combinations of varibles
- At the end, found out the linear model of the highest R squared value stratified on cause of death.


## Slide with R Output

```{r cars, echo = TRUE}
summary(cars)
```

## Slide with Plot

```{r pressure}
plot(pressure)
```
