## Introduction

Topic: Prostate cancer data analysis
Data source: Vanderbilt biostatistics dataset

Main work we did:
- 


## Variables
- Two types:-

-Categorical          Numerical
------------         ---------------
"activity"              "PA_phosphatase"
"status_"               "age"
"cause_of_death"        "diastolic_bp"  
"bone_metastases"       "months_of_follow_up"      
"ekg"                   "serum_hemoglobin"  
                        "history_of_CD"
                        "tumor_size"            
                        "study_date"
                        "weight_index"              
                        "estrogen_mg"
                        "dead_from_prostate_cancer" 
                        "Age_group"  
                        "stage" 
                        "systolic_bp"
                        "stage_grade_index"


## Data cleaning

- Importing the file into data table format
- Conversion of character types into numerical values for better analysis
e.g. placebo--> '0' mg estrogen
- Writing variables in more 'readable' format
e.g. sz--> tumor size


## Data analysis

- Error and Trial method- built lots of linear models using different combinations of varibles







- At the end, found out the linear model of the highest R squared value stratified on cause of death.
-

```{r, out.width="500px", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("/cloud/project/results/04_glm_death_model_performance.png")

```

## Plots on linear regression models

```{r, out.width="500px", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("/cloud/project/results/05_lm_bp_plots.png")

```

- R. squared value is the statistical measure of how close the data fits into the linear regression mdoel. 
- Out of all the trials, systolic_bp ~ diastolic_bp relationship gave the highest R-squared value ranging between 0.23 and 0.79.
- The left figure shows the positive relationship between systolic and diastolic rates stratified on different causes of death.
- The right figure shows the adjusted r-squared values for each cause of death in descending order. 


## plots on activity
- The patients with normal physical activity showed lowered case number with bone metastasis.

```{r, out.width="500px", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("/cloud/project/results/07_activity_bm_plot.png")

```


## plots on different doses of estrogen
- 
```{r, out.width="500px", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("/cloud/project/results/07_estrogen_plots.png")

```


## Serum hemoglobin 
- Generally, people with bone metastasis showed lower serum hemoglobin
- People of age group 80-90 showed the lowest serum heoglobin. 
```{r, out.width="500px", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("/cloud/project/results/07_hemoglobin_bm_boxplot.png")

```

## Highest PA phosphatase observed in the prostate cancer patients 

- The Highest PA phosphatase observed in the prostate cancer patients  with bone metastasis. 
- Generally, the level of PA phosphatase is higher for bone mestasis than non-bone metastasis.

```{r, out.width="500px", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("/cloud/project/results/07_PA_death_plot.png")

```

## tumor size

```{r, out.width="500px", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("/cloud/project/results/07_size_bm_boxplot.png")

knitr::include_graphics("/cloud/project/results/08_tumorsize_plot.png") 
```

## Machine Learning 







## Slide with R Output

```{r cars, echo = TRUE}
summary(cars)
```

## Slide with Plot

```{r pressure}
plot(pressure)
```
