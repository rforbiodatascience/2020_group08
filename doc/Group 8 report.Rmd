subtitle: Analysis of Byar and Greene's prostate cancer data set
---

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

## The data set

```{r load_data, include = FALSE}
library(readr)
library(knitr)
prostate_data <- read_tsv(file = "/cloud/project/Data/03_prostate_data_clean_aug.tsv")
```

```{r prostate_data, echo = TRUE, size = "small"}
head(prostate_data)
```

## Before analysing the data
- Individual dataframes joined
- Splitting cells containing multiple variables
- Converting strings to numbers
- Grouping numerical varibales in intervals
- Ensuring that all variables are correctly classified



# Identifying and visualising trends with ggplot



## Approach

- <font size="4">A large number of plots were generated quickly to more efficiently identify interesting trends</font>
- <font size="4">For this purpose the same plot was stratified on different factor columns, and in addition pivot_longer() and facet_wrap() was used</font>

```{r  out.width = "90%", fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("/cloud/project/results/00_flow_chart.png") 
```



## Seahwa's tumor size boxplot...
- <font size="4">Prostate cancer showed the second largest tumor size.</font>
- <font size="4">Other than prostate cancer, all other causes of death showed difference in stage leads to difference in the tumor size.</font>

```{r  out.width = "80%", fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("/cloud/project/results/06_tumorsize_plot.png") 
```
<font size="4">[Repo](https://github.com/rforbiodatascience/2020_group08/blob/master/R/06_metastases_plots.R) (plot #8)</font>



## Prostatic acid phosphatase and cause of death
- <font size="4">PA phosphatase levels are increased in patients with bone metastases</font>
- <font size="4">PA phosphatase levels are higher in patients that die from cancer</font>

```{r  out.width = "60%", fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("/cloud/project/results/06_PA_death_plot.png") 
```
<font size="4">[Repo](https://github.com/rforbiodatascience/2020_group08/blob/master/R/06_metastases_plots.R) (plot #1)</font>



## Tumor size and bone metastases
- <font size="4">Tumors are larger in patients that have died from prostate cancer</font>
- <font size="4">Tumors are larger in patients with metastases</font>

```{r  out.width = "60%", fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("/cloud/project/results/06_size_bm_boxplot.png") 
```
<font size="4">[Repo](https://github.com/rforbiodatascience/2020_group08/blob/master/R/06_metastases_plots.R) (plot #5)</font>



## Serum hemoglobin and bone metastases
- <font size="4">Serum hemoglobin levels are higher in patients without metastases</font>
- <font size="4">Serum hemoglobin levels drop with increased age</font>

```{r  out.width = "60%", fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("/cloud/project/results/06_hemoglobin_bm_boxplot.png") 
```
<font size="4">[Repo](https://github.com/rforbiodatascience/2020_group08/blob/master/R/06_metastases_plots.R) (plot #4)</font>



## Status and bone metastases
- <font size="4">Risk of dying from prostate cancer doubles if the cancer spreads from the prostate</font>

```{r  out.width = "90%", fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("/cloud/project/results/06_status_bm_plot.png") 
```
<font size="4">[Repo](https://github.com/rforbiodatascience/2020_group08/blob/master/R/06_metastases_plots.R) (plot #2)</font>



## Activity and bone metastases
- <font size="4">The activity level is affected by disease progress</font>
- <font size="4">Bone metastases leads to reduced activity</font>

```{r  out.width = "60%", fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("/cloud/project/results/06_activity_bm_plot.png") 
```
<font size="4">[Repo](https://github.com/rforbiodatascience/2020_group08/blob/master/R/06_metastases_plots.R) (plot #3)</font>



## Estrogen dose and status
- <font size="4">Estrogen is important for survival if the cancer has spread</font>
- <font size="4">High estrogen dose has a negetive effect as age increase</font>

```{r  out.width = "100%", fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("/cloud/project/results/06_estrogen_plots.png") 
```
<font size="4">[Repo](https://github.com/rforbiodatascience/2020_group08/blob/master/R/06_metastases_plots.R) (plot #6 and #7)</font>



# Predictive models and ANN



## Linear regression of blood pressure
- <font size="4">The only linear regression model that fit well was for diastolic blood pressure vs systolic blood pressure, grouped by cause of death</font>
- <font size="4">The best fit is for patients that have died from respiratory disease</font>

```{r  out.width = "90%", fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("/cloud/project/results/05_lm_bp_plots.png") 
```
<font size="4">[Repo](https://github.com/rforbiodatascience/2020_group08/blob/master/R/05_lm(sbp_vs_dbp).R)</font>



## Predicting death cause with logistic regression
- <font size="4">The most important predictors for predicting if a patient died from prostate cancer (determined from ANOVA) were stage/grade index and prostatic acid phosphatase levels</font>
- <font size="4">5-fold cross validation gave a model accuracy of 74.5%</font>

```{r  out.width = "45%", fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("/cloud/project/results/04_glm_death_model_performance.png") 
```
<font size="4">[Repo](https://github.com/rforbiodatascience/2020_group08/blob/master/R/04_glm_death_prediction.R)</font>



## Predicting cause of death with ANN

- <font size="4">The ANN predicts on 10 different outcomes</font>
- <font size="4">The ANN has an accuracy of 30 - 40% with 200 epochs</font>

```{r  out.width = "50%", fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("/cloud/project/results/08_ANN_model_performance.png") 
```
<font size="4">[Repo](https://github.com/rforbiodatascience/2020_group08/blob/master/R/08_keras_ANN.R)</font>



# Clustering



## Identifying clusters with PCA
- <font size="4">A PCA analysis is used to look for groupings and patterns of the data based on all variables</font>
- <font size="4">PCA analysis is not well suited for this data, since a single PCA cannot explain a lot of the variance levels</font>
- <font size="4">PC #1 only explains 22.5% of the variance</font>

```{r  out.width = "50%", fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("/cloud/project/results/07_PC_variance_plot.png") 
```
<font size="4">[Repo](https://github.com/rforbiodatascience/2020_group08/blob/master/R/07_PCA.R)</font>



## Identifying clusters with PCA
- <font size="4">No clear clusters could be identified</font>
- <font size="4">The best clusters are found when stratifying by status and if a person developed bone metastases</font>

```{r  out.width = "80%", fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("/cloud/project/results/07_PCA_plots.png") 
```
<font size="4">[Repo](https://github.com/rforbiodatascience/2020_group08/blob/master/R/07_PCA.R)</font>



## Conclusions
- Prostatic acid (PA) phosphatase levels are higher in patients with metastases and that have died from prostate cancer
- The risk of dying from prostate cancer increases with larger tumors
- Serum hemoglobin levels are lower in older patients with bone metastases
- When the cancer has metastasized the patients are less active and there is a much bigger risk of dying
- High doses of estrogen have negative effects for older patients
- Logistic regression can predict with 75% accuracy if a patient have died from prostate cancer, with the most important predictors being stage/grade index and PA phosphatase levels
- An ANN is able to predict the cause of death with 30 - 40% accuracy 
- The data has no clearly seperated clusters
