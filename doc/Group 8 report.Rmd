```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

## The data set

```{r load_data, include = FALSE}
library(readr)
library(knitr)
prostate_data <- read_tsv(file = "/cloud/project/Data/03_prostate_data_clean_aug.tsv")
```

```{r prostate_data, echo = TRUE, size = "small"}
head(prostate_data)
```

## Prostatic acid phosphatase and cause of death
- <font size="4">PA phosphatase levels are increased in patients with bone metastases</font>
- <font size="4">PA phosphatase levels are higher in patients that die from cancer</font>

```{r  out.width = "60%", fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("/cloud/project/results/06_PA_death_plot.png") 
```

## Tumor size and bone metastases
- <font size="4">Tumors are larger in patients that have died from prostate cancer</font>
- <font size="4">Tumors are larger in patients with metastases</font>

```{r  out.width = "60%", fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("/cloud/project/results/06_size_bm_boxplot.png") 
```

## Serum hemoglobin and bone metastases
- <font size="4">Serum hemoglobin levels are higher in patients without metastases</font>
- <font size="4">Serum hemoglobin levels drop with increased age</font>

```{r  out.width = "60%", fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("/cloud/project/results/06_hemoglobin_bm_boxplot.png") 
```

## Status and bone metastases
- <font size="4">Risk of dying from prostate cancer doubles if the cancer spreads from the prostate</font>

```{r  out.width = "90%", fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("/cloud/project/results/06_status_bm_plot.png") 
```

## Activity and bone metastases
- <font size="4">The activity level is affected by disease progress</font>
- <font size="4">Bone metastases leads to reduced activity</font>

```{r  out.width = "60%", fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("/cloud/project/results/06_activity_bm_plot.png") 
```

## Estrogen dose and status
- <font size="4">Estrogen is important for survival if the cancer has spread</font>
- <font size="4">High estrogen dose has a negetive effect as age increase</font>

```{r  out.width = "100%", fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("/cloud/project/results/06_estrogen_plots.png") 
```

## Linear regression of blood pressure
- <font size="4">The only linear regression model that fit well was for systolic blood pressure vs diastolic blood pressure, grouped by cause of death</font>
- <font size="4">The best fit is for patients that have died from respiratory disease</font>

```{r  out.width = "95%", fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("/cloud/project/results/05_lm_bp_plots.png") 
```

## Predicting death cause with logistic regression
- <font size="4">The most important predictors for predicting if a patient died from prostate cancer (determined from ANOVA) were stage/grade index and prostatic acid phosphatase levels</font>
- <font size="4">5-fold cross validation gave a model accuracy of 74.5%</font>

```{r  out.width = "50%", fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("/cloud/project/results/04_glm_death_model_performance.png") 
```

## Identifying clustering with PCA
- <font size="4">PCA analysis is not will suited for this data, since a single PCA cannot explain a lot of the variance levels</font>
- <font size="4">PC #1 explains 22.5% of the variance</font>

```{r  out.width = "60%", fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("/cloud/project/results/07_PC_variance_plot.png") 
```

## Identifying clustering with PCA
- <font size="4">No clear clusters could be identified</font>
- <font size="4">The best clusters are found when stratifying by status and if a person died from prostate cancer</font>

```{r  out.width = "80%", fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("/cloud/project/results/07_PCA_plots.png") 
```
